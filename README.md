## about me...<img height="40px" width="40px" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5xRW2cUKfcyQg/giphy.gif">

I study Software Analysis and Development and work as a AI software developer. My main interests include Artificial Intelligence, generative models (LLMs), reinforcement learning, and applied machine learning. I like building practical solutions for real-world challenges using Python, Java, and frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. I've also developed scalable systems and automated MLOps pipelines.

I strongly value collaboration and knowledge sharing, feel free to reach out.
