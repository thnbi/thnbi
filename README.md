## about me...<img height="40px" width="40px" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5xRW2cUKfcyQg/giphy.gif">

I'm currently studying Software Analysis and Development and working as a software developer, with special interest in Artificial Intelligence, generative models (LLMs), reinforcement learning, and practical machine learning applications. I enjoy creating solutions that tackle real-world problems, particularly with Python, Java, and modern frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I also have experience building scalable solutions and MLOps automation pipelines.

I strongly value collaboration and knowledge sharing—feel free to reach out.
